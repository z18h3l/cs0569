Music 128 2024	Transcription assignment 4
Writing out a full melody in staff or TUBS notation
This song is listed as “La Plantation du The” (The Tea Plantation) on the CD Chants des Enfants du Monde: Chine (Children’s Songs of the World: China.). It is sung in Mandarin with a Hmong “accent.” My friend Gloria Wong (who directs the UBC Chinese Music Ensemble) kindly translated it at my request and I include this on pages 3-4. Please don't write the words in your transcription; I just thought you’d be curious to see them.
There are 20 measures (as I notate it) in the song; each is worth .5 points. Transcribe only the first cycle of the song, even if you hear small variations in what follows. Use the 2/4 time signature. I provide the first two notes so you can continue from there using them as a guide to the rhythm values. The 20th measure is empty; the final notes of the song come in measure 19 and the singer rests for one measure.
If you have no experience with standard staff notation you can use the TUBS (Time Unit Box System) grids on the next page. The number of rows in the grids (8) equals the number of different pitches the singer uses. The double vertical lines are equal to the measure lines in the staff notation. Note that the two notes given on the staff are shown as x’s on the first grid, and otherwise the grids and the staff are really the same thing. Ask questions if you have them.
You may write it out on this sheet or use your own software, but keep it with 4 measures per line, and five lines. Don’t upload files directly from music notation software, make sure it is a pdf, jpeg or similar.  If you write by hand be clear. If you submit a photo of something you wrote out, make sure it is easy to read.
